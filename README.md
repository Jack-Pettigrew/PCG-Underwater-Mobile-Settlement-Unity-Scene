# PCG Underwater Mobile Settlement Scene

This is a University assignment which asked us to create a scene in Unity that featured elements of Procedural Content Generation while following an underlying theme and optional challenge.

**'Mobile Settlements'** was the theme given to us and the optional challenge chosen was **'Underwater'**. The idea behind the developed scene is a underwater Fish-people City inside a Fish Bowl, inside a moving Van. A Fish person can be seen in the background of the scene observing the settlement, showcasing the overall scale of the scene.

### Example Procedural Features
- L-System generated Road and City structure
- Real-Time NavMesh building for various City sizes 
- Procedural Terrain and Waves using Perlin Noise
- Building and Landscape overlap Behaviour
